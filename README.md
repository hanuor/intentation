# intentation
This is a wrapper for converting Intent object into a JSON and then parsing a JSON and converting it into an intent object.
An extension of Sapphire Engine, intentation can be used for storing an intent object and later retrieving it through a intent json string. 
Intentation uses Apache's commonslang for this to happen.
